  <h2>Icon Construction</h2>
  <p>
    A good Firefox icon is simple but still representing the right metaphor. Use universal metaphors that everyone around the world can quickly identify. Aim for a design most people can interpret correctly and wonâ€™t find offensive. Do not focus on a secondary or obscure aspect of an element. Remember that too many details can make an icon appear sloppy or unreadable. 
  </p>
  <h3>Grid</h3>
  <p>
    Firefox icons live on a 16x16 pixel grid. Keep your shape weighted towards the middle area of the grid reserving the outer 1px margin for visual weighting and maintaining relative aspect ratios. Designing with the pixel grid on help the icons not appear fuzzy in production.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Illustrator can turn on the pixel grid from the Transform Panel: in the options menu just tick on <code>Align new objects</code> to pixel grid feature.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Sketch, select the shape and then select <code>Layer &#8594; Round to Nearest Pixel Edge</code>. Sketch will automatically align the edges with the pixel grid. It works for both the Position and Size values. 
  </p>

  <h3>Shape</h3>
  <p>
    Use positive and negative space to create the shape of your icon. When lines principally shape your icon use a 2px stroke for the foundation and a 1px line for extra details. Rounded end caps and rounded line joins keep the icon smooth and friendly.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you have two rounded corners running parallel, the outer corner has a larger radius (usually 3px) than the one on the inside (usually 1px).

  <h2>Export your icon</h2>
  
  <h3>Flatten</h3>
  <p>
    Before exporting your icons, be sure to expand all the shapes and strokes overlapping each other. Remember to remove unnecessary anchor points to keep the icon as simple as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Sketch, you can expand all your paths by selecting <code>Layer &#8594; Paths &#8594; Vectorize Stroke</code> in the menu. In Illustrator you find this option under <code>Object &#8594; Expand</code>.
  </p>

  <h3>Naming</h3>
  <p>
    Do not forget to name the artboard with the icon name. The name should describe the action of the icon, and not the icon itself. For example, we are using a star as a metaphor for bookmarking  The name of the icon is <em>bookmark</em>, and not <em>star</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>    
    Add an <code>-</code> hyphen to underline variation in the icon.
  </p>

  <h3>Save as SVG</h3>
  <p>
    In Illustrator to save your artwork as SVG, choose <code>File &#8594; Export &#8594; SVG (svg)</code>. If you are saving more than one icons, check <code>Use Artboards</code> to export the contents of your artboards as individual SVG files. Click <code>Export</code> to open the SVG Options panel.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Sketch simply select the artboard, click <code>Make it exportable</code> in the sidebar and select <code>SVG</code> from the format menu.

    <h4>Tip</h4>
    <p>
      If you are using Sketch, be sure to have the <a href="https://github.com/BohemianCoding/svgo-compressor">SVGO Compressor plugin by Bohemian Coding</a> installed. This small plugin fixes most of the SVG issues in Sketch.

  <h2>Placement</h2>
  <p>
    Give icons space according the <a href="grid.html">the grid</a> to increase visibility and interactivity.
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Placement</th>
        <th>Size</th>
        <th>Color</th>
      </tr>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Toolbar</td>
        <td>16x16</td>
        <td>Light theme: Black with alpha channel. <br> On dark Theme: Full white</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

      <td>32x32</td>
      <td>One color</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h3>Toolbar</h3>
  <p>
    Make toolbar icons different, yet harmonious. Each icon should be easily distinguishable from the others, but at the same time, toolbar icons should harmonise as much as possible in their perspective, size, and visual weight.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the toolbar icons are 16px per 16px. They have 16px margin left and right, center-aligned.
  </p>
  <h3>Panel</h3>
  <p>
    Panel icons live in the top left of a panel. Their size is bigger than the icons that go on the chrome toolbar, therefore they can provide more detail.
  </p>

  <h3>In content</h3>
  <p>
    Preferences and administrator areas in Firefox usually include a dark sidebar navigation. Middle-align both icons and labels.

  <h2>Accessibility</h2>
  <p>
    All icons should have a text-based equivalent for screen readers. If your icon allows interactivity, give it a text label.
