  <h1>Principles</h1>
  <p>
    We distilled 6 principles from our overarching <a href="https://firefoxux.github.io/DesignValues/">Firefox Design Values</a> to guide us in our process. These principles help us to define look, feel and sound of our Firefox products.

  <h1>🍱 Adaptable</h1>
  <p>
    Firefox should adapt itself to anyone: From new users (simple controls, help/encouragement in using features) to seasoned Mozillians (customization/control of the entire browser experience).
  </p>
  <h1>😺 Approachable</h1>
  <p>
    Firefox is welcoming, open, and inclusive.
  </p>
  <h1>👮 Aware</h1>
  <p>
    Firefox is vigilant on behalf of users, providing tools to keep them safe while helping them browse better. Firefox is also perceptive, and looks for signals from users before deciding how to act.
  </p>
  <h1>🌈 Quick</h1>
  <p>
    Firefox should look and feel fast! From task completion to icon animation, Firefox is the most responsive and modern browser.
  </p>
  <h1>💪 Supportive</h1>
  <p>
    Firefox understands user needs and supports them with relevant experiences. The browser should be helpful in both proactive and passive ways.
  </p>
  <h1>🦄 Whimsical</h1>
  <p>
    Firefox is fun to use! Our browser delights the user in both expected and unexpected ways.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;
